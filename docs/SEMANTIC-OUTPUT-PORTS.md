# Semantic Output Ports Pattern Implementation

This implementation demonstrates the Semantic Output Ports pattern with the following characteristics:

## Key Files

1. **`semantic-ports.test.ts`** - Core implementation and tests
   - Domain model (User entity)
   - Semantic output ports with *OutPort naming convention
   - Use case that returns void and communicates through output ports
   - Comprehensive tests with detailed explanations

2. **`semantic-ports-flexibility.test.ts`** - Platform flexibility tests
   - Demonstrates switching between presentation adapters
   - Shows consistent business DTOs across platforms
   - Verifies naming convention compliance

3. **Example files** (self-documenting):
   - `presentation-adapters.example.ts` - Console and web adapters
   - `data-adapters.example.ts` - In-memory repository implementation
   - `composition-root.example.ts` - Port binding examples
   - `main.example.ts` - Application entry point

## Pattern Principles Demonstrated

1. **Use Cases Return Void**: Use cases call semantic output ports instead of returning data
2. **Semantic Output Ports**: Each business outcome has a dedicated, semantically named port
3. **Naming Convention**: All output ports use the `*OutPort` suffix for clear identification
4. **Business DTOs**: Pure domain data passed to output ports, no UI concerns
5. **Platform Flexibility**: Easy to switch between presentation adapters
6. **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic completely separated from presentation

## Test Coverage

All tests pass and demonstrate:
- Success and failure paths
- Platform switching capabilities
- Business DTO consistency
- Naming convention compliance
- Error handling patterns

The implementation is self-documenting through clear code structure, comprehensive comments, and example-based tests.
