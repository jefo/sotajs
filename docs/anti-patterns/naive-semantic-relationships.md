# Anti-Pattern: Naive Semantic Relationships (The God Aggregate Problem)

This document describes a common anti-pattern in Domain-Driven Design when modeling relationships between Aggregates and Entities. While seemingly intuitive, this approach leads to significant architectural and performance issues.

## The Naive Approach

The naive approach attempts to model all semantic relationships by directly embedding references (or collections of references) to other Aggregates or Entities within the `props` of a single Aggregate. This often manifests as adding `BrandedId`s or arrays of `BrandedId`s to an Aggregate's schema, intending for that Aggregate to manage the lifecycle and consistency of these relationships.

**Example:** Consider a complex system like an MBSE (Model-Based Systems Engineering) application, where a `Project` Aggregate might contain `Requirement`s, `UseCases`, `TestCases`, `Parts`, `Services`, etc. A naive approach might try to model all interconnections within a single `Project` Aggregate:

```typescript
// docs/anti-patterns/naive-semantic-relationships.md (Illustrative Example)

import { z } from 'zod';
import { RequirementId, UseCaseId, TestCaseId, PartId, ServiceId } from './ids'; // Assuming BrandedIds

const ProjectSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  name: z.string(),
  // ... other project properties

  // Naive attempt to manage all relationships within the Project Aggregate
  requirements: z.array(z.object({
    id: RequirementId.schema,
    description: z.string(),
    satisfiesTestCaseIds: z.array(TestCaseId.schema), // Link to TestCases
    derivesFromRequirementIds: z.array(RequirementId.schema), // Self-referencing
  })),
  useCases: z.array(z.object({
    id: UseCaseId.schema,
    // ...
    implementsRequirementIds: z.array(RequirementId.schema),
  })),
  testCases: z.array(z.object({
    id: TestCaseId.schema,
    // ...
    verifiesRequirementIds: z.array(RequirementId.schema),
  })),
  // ... and so on for Parts, Services, etc.
});

// The Project Aggregate would then have actions like:
// Project.actions.linkRequirementToTestCase(reqId, testCaseId)
// Project.actions.addDerivedRequirement(parentReqId, childReqId)
```

## Problems with the Naive Approach

This seemingly straightforward approach quickly leads to severe architectural and operational problems:

1.  **The "God Aggregate" Anti-Pattern:**
    *   The Aggregate becomes responsible for too many unrelated concerns. A `Project` Aggregate managing all relationships between `Requirement`s, `TestCases`, and `Parts` violates the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**. Its actions become bloated and complex.
    *   It becomes a central bottleneck for all changes, as any modification to any linked entity requires loading, modifying, and saving the entire `Project` Aggregate.

2.  **Performance and Scalability Issues:**
    *   **Excessive Loading:** To perform a simple operation (e.g., link one `Requirement` to one `TestCase`), the entire `Project` Aggregate, potentially containing thousands of `Requirement`s, `UseCase`s, etc., must be loaded into memory. This is highly inefficient.
    *   **Concurrency Bottleneck:** Since an Aggregate is a transactional consistency boundary, only one operation can modify it at a time. A large, all-encompassing Aggregate becomes a massive concurrency bottleneck, severely limiting throughput.

3.  **Violation of Aggregate Boundaries:**
    *   While the references are by ID, the *management* of these relationships is centralized. This implicitly breaks the independent consistency boundaries that Aggregates are designed to provide. If `Requirement` and `TestCase` are truly independent business concepts, they should be independent Aggregates.

4.  **Complex and Fragile Actions:**
    *   The `actions` within such a God Aggregate become incredibly complex, needing to navigate deep nested structures and manage bidirectional consistency manually. This increases the likelihood of bugs and makes the code difficult to understand and maintain.

5.  **Testing Nightmare:**
    *   Testing a single action on such a large Aggregate requires setting up a massive amount of test data, making tests slow, brittle, and hard to write.

## The Correct Approach

The correct approach is to model relationships based on their type (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) while strictly adhering to Aggregate boundaries. This involves referencing other aggregates by ID and, in some cases, creating dedicated "Relationship Aggregates".
